GAME STRUCTURE

To play this game and get the maximum score possible, please follow these instructions:

* At the start of the game, ensure CAPS LOCK is on and click on Start Game to begin

* Move the character on the screen in any direction of your choice within the boundaries of the board using the direction keys on your keyboard

* Once the character is at any light-brown colored tile, you will be prompted to choose a category from which you have to answer questions in order to gain points

* You can choose the category by pressing the letter on the keyboard that corresponds to the category. For example if A. Geography, you press “A” on the keyboard. 

* Once the question is displayed, select your correct answer by pressing either 1, 2, 3, or 4, and then wait for the tile to change its color accordingly before making the next step. This may take a while depending on your computer, please wait if need be.

* If you answer a question correctly, the current tile where the character is standing will be colored green and considered conquered and you will keep on moving forward. For every question answered correctly, 100 points are earned 

* If  a question is not answered correctly, then you’ll lose a life and one heart will disappear from the five hearts/lives you have at the topmost right corner, and the current tile where the character is standing will turn red

* If you keep on failing questions, more hearts will be lost and if there are no more hearts left, then the player is considered dead and the game is lost

However, if you make it to the high score (1000 points), you will be asked to walk to the goal for your reward.
The questions are randomly generated from the internet.
