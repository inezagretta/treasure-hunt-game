# Trivia - Interactive Learning Game

Welcome to Trivia, an engaging and dynamic educational game designed to enhance user engagement and facilitate interactive learning.

## How to Play

To play this game and achieve the maximum score, please follow these instructions:

1. At the start of the game, ensure CAPS LOCK is on and click on "Start Game" to begin.

2. Move the character on the screen using the direction keys on your keyboard. Navigate within the boundaries of the board.

3. When the character lands on a light-brown colored tile, you will be prompted to choose a category. Select a category by pressing the corresponding letter on your keyboard (e.g., "A" for Geography).

4. Once the question is displayed, choose your answer by pressing either 1, 2, 3, or 4. Wait for the tile to change color before making the next move. Please be patient as this may take some time depending on your computer.

5. Correct answers will turn the current tile green and be considered conquered. You will continue moving forward and earn 100 points for each correct answer.

6. Incorrect answers will result in a lost life. One heart will disappear from the five hearts/lives at the top-right corner, and the current tile will turn red.

7. If you continue to answer questions incorrectly, you will lose more hearts. If all hearts are lost, the player is considered defeated, and the game is lost.

8. Achieving a high score of 1000 points will prompt you to walk to the goal for your reward.
